# Megusta

Megusta is a Multichain Casual Gaming Platform being built by the Dark Sun Labs. The games mix competitive spirit with childhood nostalgia and fun with classics like Snake and Tetris, and memory and deduction based based games like Nonogram and Mental Matchmaking. All games will be in P2E (Play to Earn) format tournaments. More details coming soon.
